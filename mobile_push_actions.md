## Creating a Push package binding
{: #create_push_binding}

To create a Push Notifications package binding, you must specify the following parameters:

-  **appId**: The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} **App GUID**.
-  **appSecret**: The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Push notification service **App Secret**.

To create a package binding, see the following steps:

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application in the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard](http://cloud.ibm.com).

2. Initialize the Push Notification Service and bind the service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application.

3. Configure the [Push Notification application](/docs/services/mobilepush?topic=mobile-pushnotification-gettingstartedtemplate).

  Be sure to remember the **App GUID** and the **App Secret** of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} app you created.

4. Create a package binding with the `/whisk.system/pushnotifications`.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myPush -p appId myAppID -p appSecret myAppSecret
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Verify that the package binding exists:
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package list
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  packages
  /myNamespace/myPush private binding
  ```
  {: screen}

## Sending push notifications
{: #send_push_notifications}

See the following example to send a Push notification from the Push notification package.

Send a Push notification by using the **sendMessage** action in the package binding that you created previously. Be sure to replace `/myNamespace/myPush` with your package name.
```
ibmcloud fn action invoke /myNamespace/myPush/sendMessage --blocking --result -p url https://example.com -p text "this is my message" -p sound soundFileName -p deviceIds "[\"T1\",\"T2\"]"
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
{
  "result": {
  "pushResponse":
    {
      "messageId":"11111H",
      "message":{
        "alert":"this is my message",
        "url":""
      },
      "settings":{
        "apns":{
          "sound":"default"
        },
        "gcm":{
          "sound":"default"
          },
        "target":{
          "deviceIds":["T1","T2"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "status": "success",
  "success": true
}
```
