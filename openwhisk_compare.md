# Function as a Service compared
{: #openwhisk_faas_compared}

Serverless architecture is not a panacea to all computing problems, but it does solve some. There are [many uses cases](./openwhisk_use_cases.html) when serverless design can be a good choice. The following architectures are compared:
{: shortdesc}

1. **Function as a Service (FaaS)** - managed OpenWhisk. IBM is the only vendor to offer managed [OpenWhisk on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk). A good introduction to the serverless programming model by using a FaaS platform is available on [Martin Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html).

2. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** with OpenWhisk Roll Your Own (RYO). End users can download OpenWhisk from Apache Incubation Project and install and run it on [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IaaS](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=devices), or other [IaaS cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29).

3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** - managed application runtime. A good example is [Liberty for Java](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/liberty-for-java) runtime that is managed by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CloudFoundry implementation.

4. **Container as a Service (CaaS)** - managed container environment. A good example is IBMâ€™s [Containers on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=containerImages).

5. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** with Java EE runtime. A good example is [WebSphere Application Server VM on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/websphere-application-server) from IBM.

A summary of pros and cons for each architecture is provided from the **perspective of an end user** who is developing, and operating applications on these different runtimes:


| Topic | (1) OpenWhisk FaaS | (2) OpenWhisk RYO | (3) PaaS | (4) CaaS | (5) IaaS+Java EE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|	Application unit	|	Single function (usually small block of code in JavaScript, Swift, or Docker container) - can be less than one Kb, but can be larger. Usually not more than few Kb.	|	Same as column (1)	|	Depends on the runtime used. An EAR or WAR file, or other language-specific application bundle, usually relatively large - Kb or even Mb with many services in a bundle, but can be as small as a single service.	|	Docker container is the unit of deployment.	|	VM with App Server with EAR or WAR file and other dependencies - usually sized at Gb.	|
|	Resource footprint	|	End user does not pay or care about memory, CPU, or other resources. Although the Action does have some footprint, the user does not need to worry about it	|	High. The end user must first provision IaaS environment and only then install and configure OpenWhisk on top of it	|	Small. End user pays for memory and CPU for running apps, but nothing for apps that are not running	|	Small to Medium	|	High. End user has to pay for disk storage, memory, CPUs, and possibly other components when the app is running. When it is stopped only the storage costs occur	|
|	Installation and setup	|	None required	|	Hard - all done by the end user	|	None required	|	Moderate - Hardware, networking, OS, container mgmt tools provided by CaaSs vendor, images, connectivity, and instances by end user	|	Hard - Hardware, networking, OS, initial Java EE installation provided by vendor, additional configuration, clustering, scaling by end user	|
|	Provisioning time	|	Milliseconds	|	See columns (4) and (5)	|	Minutes	|	Minutes	|	Hours	|
|	Ongoing administration	|	None	|	Hard	|	None	|	Moderate	|	Hard	|
|	Elastic scaling	|	Each Action is always instantly and inherently scaled depending on the load. No need to provision VMs or other resources in advance	|	Not provided - end user must provide compute capacity on IaaS and manage scaling of VMs. Once VMs are scaled, OpenWhisk scales Actions automatically, but the resources must already be provisioned in advance	|	Automatic, but slow scaling. During increased load, for several minutes users might wait for scale Action to complete. Auto scaling requires careful tuning	|	Automatic, but slow scaling. During increased load, for several minutes users might wait for scale Action to complete. Auto scaling requires careful tuning	|	Not provided	|
|	Capacity planning	|	Not needed. FaaS automatically provides as much capacity as needed	|	Need to provision enough capacity in advance or script it	|	Some capacity planning is needed, but some automatic capacity increase is provided	|	Some capacity planning is needed, but some automatic capacity increase is provided	|	Need to statically provision enough capacity to handle peak workload	|
|	Persistent connections and state	|	Limited - cannot keep a persistent connection, except in cases of container caching. Generally state must be kept in external resource	|	Same as column (1)	|	Supported - can keep an open socket or connection for long times, can store state in memory between calls	|	Supported - can keep an open socket or connection for long times, can store state in memory between calls	|	Supported - can keep an open socket or connection for long times, can store state in memory between calls	|
|	Maintenance	|	None - The entire stack is managed by IBM.	|	Significant - Depends on the target environment, User must provision hardware, networking, OS, storage, DB, install and maintain OpenWhisk, and so on.	|	None - The entire stack is managed by vendor.	|	Significant - User must create and maintain custom images, deploy and manage containers, connections between containers, and so on.	|	Significant - User must allocate VMs, manage, and scale Java EE servers individually.	|
|	High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR)	|	Inherent / no extra costs	|	Roll your own (RYO) 	|	Available at extra cost	|	Failed containers can be automatically restarted	|	Available at extra cost, semi-automatic. VMs can be automatically failed over	|
|	Security	|	Vendor provided	|	Roll your own (RYO)	|	Mix of RYO and vendor provided	|	Mix of RYO and vendor provided	|	Roll your own (RYO)	|
|	Developer velocity	|	Highest	|	Highest	|	Highest	|	Average	|	Slow	|
|	Resource utilization (idle resources that still need to be paid for)	|	Resources are never idle as they are invoked only upon request. When workload is absent, no cost or resource allocation occurs.	|	Because this option is using IaaS or CaaS - similar considerations apply as in columns (4) and (5)	|	Some resources can be idle, and autoscaling helps to eliminate idle resources. A number of running instances must always be present, and are likely to be used at less than 50% of their capacity. Stopped instances do not cost anything	|	Similar to column (3)	|	Some resources can be idle, but autoscaling is not supported. Some number of running instances must always be present, and are likely to be used at less than 50% of their capacity. Stopped instances can incur the cost of storage	|
|	Maturity	|	Early maturity	|	Early maturity	|	Early maturity	|	Moderate maturity	|	Highly mature	|
|	Resource limits	|	[Some limits exist](./openwhisk_reference.html#openwhisk_syslimits)	|	Depends on allocated resources	|	No	|	No	|	No	|
|	Latency for rarely used services	|	Rare requests can initially see several seconds response time, but remain in ms range for subsequent requests	|	Depends	|	Low	|	Low	|	Low - assuming the system has enough resources	|
|	Sweet spot type of application	|	Event processing, IoT, Mobile backend, microservices. Definitely not for monolithic applications. See [use cases](./openwhisk_use_cases.html)	|	Same as column (1), but when user wants to run on non-IBM cloud or run on-prem.	|	Web applications with 24x7 workload load, stateful services that need to keep the connection open for long periods of time. Can be used to run microservices or monolithic applications	|	Ideal for microservices applications.	|	Traditional enterprise applications that are migrated from on-prem to the cloud. Ideal for monolithic applications	|
|	Charging granularity and billing	|	[Per blocks of 100 milliseconds](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/pricing)	|	Depends on implementation - If IaaS or CaaS are used, then similar considerations apply - See columns (4) and (5)	|	Usually charged per hour (rarely per minute) for bundle of resources (CPU + memory + some disk space)	|	Similar to column (3)	|	Similar to column (3)	|
|	Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)	|	For its sweet spot, applications are likely to cost an order of magnitude less than alternatives. Because resources are automatically scaled, over provisioning does not occur.	|	For cloud deployments, it is likely to be more expensive than OpenWhisk FaaS, but on-prem deployment can be cheaper than traditional architectures	|	Relatively low - The user does not need to provision or manage resources, and can focus on application development. Some level of over provisioning compared to serverless	|	Moderate - The user needs to provision and manage containers and application, and could see some level of over provisioning compared to serverless or PaaS	|	Relatively high - Consider that migration of legacy applications into the cloud native model could be prohibitively expensive, this can be a viable and economical choice for those apps.	|
