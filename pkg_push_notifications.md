### Creating a Push package binding
{: #pkg_push_create}

To create a Push Notifications package binding, you must specify the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `appId` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} **App GUID**. |
| `appSecret` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Push Notification service **App Secret**. |

To create a package binding, see the following steps:

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.

2. Initialize the Push Notification Service and bind the service to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application.

3. Configure the [Push Notification application](/docs/services/mobilepush?topic=mobile-pushnotification-getting-started).

  Be sure to remember the **App GUID** and the **App Secret** of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app you created.

4. Create a package binding with the `/whisk.system/pushnotifications`.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myPush -p appId myAppID -p appSecret myAppSecret
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Verify that the package binding exists:
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package list
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Example output**
  ```
  packages
  /myNamespace/myPush private binding
  ```
  {: screen}

### Example push notification
{: #pkg_push_ex}

See the following example to send a push notification from the Push notification package.

Send a push notification by using the **sendMessage** action in the package binding that you created previously. Be sure to replace `/myNamespace/myPush` with your package name.
```
ibmcloud fn action invoke /myNamespace/myPush/sendMessage --blocking --result -p url https://example.com -p text "this is my message" -p sound soundFileName -p deviceIds "[\"T1\",\"T2\"]"
```
{: pre}

**Example output**
```
{
  "result": {
  "pushResponse":
    {
      "messageId":"11111H",
      "message":{
        "alert":"this is my message",
        "url":""
      },
      "settings":{
        "apns":{

## Sending push notifications on mobile device events
{: #pkg_push_mobile}

This pre-installed package is not available in the Tokyo region.
{: tip}

Learn how to configure the Push Notification service to fire a trigger when there is device activity such as device (registration/unregistration) or (subscription/unsubscription) in a specified application.
{: shortdesc}

### Parameters
{: #pkg_push_mobile_params}

The `/whisk.system/pushnotifications/webhook` parameters are as follows:

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | --- |
| `appId` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app GUID. |
| `appSecret` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Push Notification service `appSecret`. |
| `events` | `onDeviceRegister`, `onDeviceUnregister`, `onDeviceUpdate`, `onSubscribe`, `onUnsubscribe`. You can use the wildcard character "`*`" to be notified for all events. |

### Firing a trigger event on Push Notifications service activity
{: #pkg_push_mobile_trigger}

To create a trigger that is fired each time a new device registers with the Push Notifications service application, see the following example:

1. Create a package binding that is configured for your Push Notifications service by using your `appId` and `appSecret`.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myNewDeviceFeed --param appID myapp --param appSecret myAppSecret --param events onDeviceRegister
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Create a trigger for the Push Notifications service `onDeviceRegister` event type by using your `myPush/webhook` feed.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn trigger create myPushTrigger --feed myPush/webhook --param events onDeviceRegister
  ```
  {: pre}

3. You can create a rule that sends a message every time a new device is registered. Create a rule by using the previous action and trigger.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn rule create --enable myRule myPushTrigger sendMessage
  ```
  {: pre}

4. Check the results by using the `ibmcloud fn activation poll` command.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn activation poll
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Register a device in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application. You can see the `rule`, `trigger`, and `action` are executed in the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/openwhisk/dashboard){: external}.

  **Output**
  
  The action sends a push notification.
