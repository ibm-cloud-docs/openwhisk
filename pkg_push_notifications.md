# Push Notifications
{: #pkg_push_notifications}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you can’t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

### Creating a Push package binding
{: #pkg_push_create}

To create a Push Notifications package binding, you must specify the following parameters.
{: shortdesc}

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `appId` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} **App GUID**. |
| `appSecret` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Push Notification service **App Secret**. |
{: caption="Table 3. Push notification package binding options" caption-side="bottom"}

To create a package binding, see the following steps:

1. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.

2. Initialize the Push Notification Service and bind the service to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application.

3. Configure the Push Notification application.

    Be sure to remember the **App GUID** and the **App Secret** of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app you created.

4. Create a package binding with the `/whisk.system/pushnotifications`.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myPush -p appId myAppID -p appSecret myAppSecret
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Verify that the package binding exists.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn package list
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**

    ```sh
    packages
    /<namespace_ID>/myPush private binding

### Example push notification
{: #pkg_push_ex}

See the following example to send a push notification from the Push notification package.
{: shortdesc}

Send a push notification by using the `sendMessage` action in the package binding that you created previously. Be sure to replace `/<namespace_ID>/myPush` with your package name.

```sh
ibmcloud fn action invoke /<namespace_ID>/myPush/sendMessage --blocking --result -p url https://example.com -p text "this is my message" -p sound soundFileName -p deviceIds "[\"T1\",\"T2\"]"
```
{: pre}

The following example shows possible output from the **`action invoke`** command.

```sh
{
    "result": {
    "pushResponse":
    {
        "messageId":"11111H",
        "message":{
        "alert":"this is my message",
        "url":""
        },
        "settings":{
        "apns":{
          "sound":"default"
        },
        "gcm":{
          "sound":"default"
          },

{: shortdesc}

This preinstalled package is not available in the Tokyo region.
{: tip}

### Parameters for Push Notification on mobile devices
{: #pkg_push_mobile_params}

The `/whisk.system/pushnotifications/webhook` parameters are as follows:
{: shortdesc}

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | --- |
| `appId` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app GUID. |
| `appSecret` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Push Notification service `appSecret`. |

{: caption="Table 5. Push notification webhook parameters" caption-side="bottom"}

### Firing a trigger event on Push Notifications service activity
{: #pkg_push_mobile_trigger}

To create a trigger that is fired each time a new device registers with the Push Notifications service application, see the following example:
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a package binding that is configured for your Push Notifications service by using your `appId` and `appSecret`.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/pushnotifications myNewDeviceFeed --param appID myapp --param appSecret myAppSecret --param events onDeviceRegister
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Create a trigger for the Push Notifications service `onDeviceRegister` event type by using your `myPush/webhook` feed.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn trigger create myPushTrigger --feed myPush/webhook --param events onDeviceRegister
    ```
    {: pre}

3. You can create a rule that sends a message every time a new device is registered. Create a rule by using the previous action and trigger.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn rule create --enable myRule myPushTrigger sendMessage
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Check the results by using the `ibmcloud fn activation poll` command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn activation poll
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Register a device in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} application. You can see the `rule`, `trigger`, and `action` are executed in the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/dashboard){: external}.

    **Output**

    The action sends a push notification.
