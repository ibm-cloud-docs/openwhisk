# WebSocket
{: #pkg_websocket}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

The preinstalled `/whisk.system/websocket` package for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} offers a convenient way to post messages to a WebSocket.
{: shortdesc}

The package includes the following actions.

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/websocket` | Package | `uri` | Utilities for communicating with WebSockets |
| `/whisk.system/websocket/send` | Action | `uri`, `payload` | Send the payload to the WebSocket URI. |
{: caption="Table 1. WebSocket package entities" caption-side="bottom"}

If you plan to send many messages to the same WebSocket URI, creating a package binding with the `uri` value is suggested. With binding, you don't need to specify the value each time that you use the `send` action.

## Send a message to a WebSocket
{: #send-websocket}

The `/whisk.system/websocket/send` action sends a payload to a WebSocket URI. The parameters are as follows.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | The URI of the WebSocket server. For example, `ws://mywebsockethost:80`. |
| `payload` | The message to send to the WebSocket. |
