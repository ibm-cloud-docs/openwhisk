# Cloud Object Storage package
{: #cloud_object_storage_actions}

The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} package provides a set of actions for interacting with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instances. These actions allow you to read, write, and delete from the buckets that are present on an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} package includes the following actions:

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/cloud-object-storage` | package | apikey, resource_instance_id, cos_hmac_keys.access_key_id, cos_hmac_keys.secret_access_key | Work with an {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/object-write` | action | bucket, key, body, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Write an object to a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/object-read` | action | bucket, key, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Read an object from a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/object-delete` | action | bucket, key, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Delete an object from a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/bucket-cors-put` | action | bucket, corsConfig, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Assign a CORS configuration to a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/bucket-cors-get` | action | bucket, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Read the CORS configuration of a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/bucket-cors-delete` | action | bucket, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Delete the CORS configuration of a bucket. |
| `/cloud-object-storage/client-get-signed-url` | action | bucket, key, operation, expires, endpoint, ibmAuthEndpoint | Obtain a signed URL to restrict the Write, Read, and Delete of an object from a bucket. |

## Package and action parameters

#### Package parameters

The following parameters are expected to be bound to the package; this will make them automatically available for all actions. It is also possible to specify these parameters when invoking one of the actions.

**apikey**: The `apikey ` parameter is IAM API key for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance.

**resource_instance_id**: The `resource_instance_id` parameter is the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance indentifier.

**cos_hmac_keys**: The `cos_hmac_keys` parameter is the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance HMAC credentials, which includes the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` values.  These credentials are used exclusively by the `client-get-signed-url` action.  Refer to [Using HMAC Credentials](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/hmac?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials#service-credentials) for instructions on how to generate HMAC credentials for your {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance.

#### Action parameters

The following parameters are specified when invoking the individual actions.  Not all of these parameters are suppoted by every action; refer to the above table to see which parameters are supporte by which action.

**bucket**: The `bucket` parameter is the name of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_object_storage_short_notm}} bucket.

**endpoint**: The `endpoint` parameter is the {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} endpoint used to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} instance. You can locate your endpoint in the [{{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} documentation](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-select_endpoints#select_endpoints).

**expires**: The `expires` parameter is the number of seconds to expire the pre-signed URL operation.  The default `expires` value is 15 minutes.

**ibmAuthEndpoint**: The `ibmAuthEndpoint ` parameter is the IBM Cloud authorization endpoint used by {site.data.keyword.cos_short}} to generate a token from the `apikey`. The default authorization endpoint should work for all IBM Cloud Regions.

**key**: The `key` parameter is the bucket object key.

**operation**: The `operation` parameter is the pre-signed URL's operation to call.

**corsConfig**: The `corsConfig` parameter is a bucket's CORS configuration.


## Creating an IBM Cloud Object Storage service instance
{: #cloud_object_storage_service_instance}

Before you install the package, you must request an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} and create at least one bucket.
