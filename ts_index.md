# Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting}

If you have problems while you're working with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting and getting help.
{: shortdesc}


## System limits were reached
{: #limits}

{: tsSymptoms}
Your function is not running properly because a limit has been reached, such as memory usage maximum or a timeout.

{: tsCauses}
All functions have minimum and maximum [system limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-openwhisk_reference#openwhisk_syslimits).

{: tsResolve}
Some limits can be increased if a business case can justify higher safety limit values. To increase the limit value, contact IBM support by opening a ticket directly from the IBM Cloud Functions web console.

1. Select **Support**.
2. Select **Add Ticket** from the drop down menu.
3. Select **Technical** for the ticket type.
4. Select **Functions** for Technical area of support.
