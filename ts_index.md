# Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting}

If you have problems while you're working with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting and getting help.
{: shortdesc}



## Action is failing
{: #ts_action_fails}

{: tsSymptoms}
The action is failing.

{: tsCauses}
One explanation for a failing app is that a deprecated runtime is being used. An action cannot be completed successfully until the runtime is updated to a supported one.

{: tsResolve}
To see which runtime is used for the action, run `ibmcloud fn action get ACTION_NAME` and check for `deprecated=true` in the query response. If the runtime is deprecated, [update the runtime](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-actions#actions_update).

## System limits were reached
{: #ts_limit_reached}

{: tsSymptoms}
Your function is not running properly because a limit has been reached, such as memory usage maximum or a timeout.

{: tsCauses}
All functions have minimum and maximum [system limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-limits#limits_syslimits).

{: tsResolve}
Some limits can be increased if a business case can justify higher safety limit values. To increase the limit value, contact IBM support by opening a ticket directly from the IBM Cloud Functions web console.

1. Select **Support**.
2. Select **Add Ticket** from the drop down menu.
3. Select **Technical** for the ticket type.
4. Select **Functions** for Technical area of support.
