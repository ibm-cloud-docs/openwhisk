# {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}}
{: #pkg_tone_analyzer}

The installable {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzerfull}} service uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional and language tones in written text.
{:shortdesc}

The service can analyze tone at both the document and sentence levels. You can use the service to understand how your written communications are perceived and then to improve the tone of your communications. Businesses can use the service to learn the tone of their customers' communications and to respond to each customer, or to understand and improve their customer conversations.

Request logging is disabled for the Tone Analyzer service. The service doesn't log or retain data from requests and responses, regardless of whether the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` request header is set.

## Creating a {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service instance
{: #service_instance_tone}

Before you install the package, you must create a {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service instance and service credentials.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service instance ](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/tone_analyzer){: external}.
2. When the service instance is created, auto-generated service credentials are also created for you.

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} package
{: #install_tone}

After you have a {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service instance, use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} CLI to install the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} package into your namespace.
{: shortdesc}

### Installing from the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI
{: #toneanalyzer_cli}

**Before you begin**
[Install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cli_install).

To install the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} package:

1. Clone the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} package repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/openwhisk-sdk
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Deploy the package.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn deploy -m openwhisk-sdk/packages/tone-analyzer-v3/manifest.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the package is added to your package list.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn package list
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Output**
    ```
    packages
    /myOrg_mySpace/tone-analyzer-v3                        private
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Bind the credentials from the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} instance you created to the package.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn service bind tone_analyzer tone-analyzer-v3
    ```
    {: pre}

    Depending on the region where you created the service instance, the service instance might be named differently because it is an IAM service. If the command fails, use the following service name for the bind command:
    ```
    ibmcloud fn service bind tone-analyzer tone-analyzer-v3
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**
    ```
    Credentials 'Credentials-1' from 'tone_analyzer' service instance 'Watson Tone Analyzer' bound to 'tone-analyzer-v3'.
    ```
    {: screen}

    ```
    ibmcloud fn package get tone-analyzer-v3 parameters
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**
    ```
    ok: got package tone-analyzer-v3, displaying field parameters
    [
      {
        "key": "__bx_creds",
