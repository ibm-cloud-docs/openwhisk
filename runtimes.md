# Runtimes
{: #runtimes}
Your apps can be coded and executed in programming languages such as Javascript or Python. Many runtimes are available by default with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

View the available runtimes for IBM Cloud Functions in each region. The following links return a JSON response. The `runtimes` section of the response contains the set of available runtimes. The `image` section contains the name of the runtime image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and the tag that is used.

  - [`us-south`](https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/)
  - [`us-east`](https://us-east.functions.cloud.ibm.com/)
  - [`eu-gb`](https://eu-gb.functions.cloud.ibm.com/)
  - [`eu-de`](https://eu-de.functions.cloud.ibm.com/)


The following examples point to the images `ibmfunctions/action-nodejs-v10` and `openwhisk/nodejs8action`.
The tags can be version numbers like `1.9.0` or the short form of a git commit hash, like `b99d71e`.

Example image fields.
  ```
  image:   "ibmfunctions/action-nodejs-v10:1.9.0"
  ```
  ```
  image:   "openwhisk/nodejs8action:b99d71e"
  ```

Runtimes are updated regularly. These updates include security fixes and minor version updates to the packages inside the runtimes. Minor version updates might introduce backward compatibility breaks. Runtime updates might impact your actions. You must migrate actions that are running a runtime to a newer version by updating it.

Apps that run on deprecated runtimes cannot be completed successfully until the runtime is updated to a supported one. When troubleshooting a failing action, to identify whether a runtime is deprecated, check for `deprecated=true` in the query response. To update the runtime, see [changing action runtime](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-actions#actions_update)

These runtimes are deprecated:
<ul>
  <li><code>nodejs:6</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>php:7.1</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>php:7.2</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>swift:3</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>swift:3.1.1</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>swift:4.1</code> (deprecated)</li>
  <li><code>ballerina:0.990</code> (deprecated)</li>
</ul>



## JavaScript runtimes
{: #openwhisk_ref_javascript_environments}

By default, all Node.js actions are executed in a version 10 environment.
{: note}

JavaScript actions can be executed in Node.js version 8 or 10. Node.js version 8 is in maintenance mode and is available until December 2019. See the [Node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release). 
{: deprecated}

| Runtime | Description | Changelog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [8.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.15.0/) | The Node.js version 8.15.0 is used if the `--kind` flag is explicitly specified with a value of `nodejs:8` when creating or updating an action. | [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ibm-functions/runtime-nodejs/blob/master/nodejs8/CHANGELOG.md). |
| [10.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.15.0/) | The Node.js version 10 environment is used if the `--kind` flag is explicitly specified with a value of `nodejs:10` when creating or updating an action. | [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ibm-functions/runtime-nodejs/blob/master/nodejs10/CHANGELOG.md). |


### Migrating from nodeJS 8 to nodeJS 10

| Package | Details |
| --- | --- |
| `ibm_db` | The `ibm_db` NPM package is not available in `nodejs:10`. The `ibm_db` package doesn't support Node.js 10. You can track progress in [this issue](https://github.com/ibmdb/node-ibm_db/issues/482#issuecomment-436895541). |

## Swift runtime
{: #swift-actions}

By default, all Swift actions are executed in a version 4.2 environment.
{: note}

Swift 4.x action runtimes don't embed any packages, follow the instructions for [packaged swift actions](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-prep#prep_swift42_single) to include dependencies using a Package.swift.

Swift 4.2 actions can use the following packages when using single Swift source file:
- Watson Developer Cloud SDK version 1.2.0, https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk


### <ph class="ignoreSpelling">SwiftyJSON</ph> using a single source action file
If you have an action that is not compiled, and uses the `SwiftyJSON` package, you need to pre-compile your action, and specify the version of `SwiftyJSON` you want to use for `swift:4.2` kind action.


## PHP runtime
{: #openwhisk_ref_php}

By default, all PHP actions are executed in a version 7.3 environment.
{: note}

The following PHP extensions are available in addition to the standard ones:

- `bcmath`
- `curl`
- `gd`
- `intl`
- `mbstring`
- `mysqli`
- `pdo_mysql`
- `pdo_pgsql`
- `pdo_sqlite`
- `soap`
- `zip`

## Docker runtime
{: #openwhisk_ref_docker}

Docker actions run a user-supplied executable in a Docker container. The executable runs in a Docker image based on [python:3.6-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/python), so the executable must be compatible with this distribution.

The Docker skeleton is a convenient way to build OpenWhisk compatible Docker images. You can install the skeleton with the `ibmcloud fn sdk install docker` CLI plug-in command.

The main executable program must be located in `/action/exec` inside the container. The executable receives the input arguments from a single command-line argument string, which can be deserialized as a `JSON` object. It must return a result by using `stdout` as a single-line string of serialized `JSON`.

You can include any compilation steps or dependencies by modifying the `Dockerfile` included in the `dockerSkeleton`.
