# Custom event providers
{: #openwhisk_feeds}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} supports an open API, where any user can expose an event producer service as a **feed** in a **package**. The following section describes architectural, and implementation options for providing your own custom feed.
{: shortdesc}

This material is intended for advanced {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} users who intend to publish their own feeds. Most {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} users can safely skip the following architecture section.

## Feed Architecture

There are at least three architectural patterns for creating a feed: **Hooks**, **Polling**, and **Connections**.

### Hooks
In the *Hooks* pattern, a feed is set up by using a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) facility that is exposed by another service.   In this strategy, a webhook is configured on an external service to POST directly to a URL to fire a trigger. This method is by far the easiest and most attractive option for implementing low-frequency feeds.

<!-- The github feed is implemented using webhooks.  Put a link here when we have the open repo ready -->

### Polling
In the "Polling" pattern, a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} *Action* is arranged to poll an endpoint periodically to fetch new data. This pattern is relatively easy to build, but the frequencies of events are limited by the polling interval.

### Connections
In the "Connections"  pattern, a separate service maintains a persistent connection to a feed source. The connection-based implementation might interact with a service endpoint to by using long polling intervals, or to set up a push notification.

<!-- Our cloudant changes feed is connection based.  Put a link here to
an open repo -->

<!-- What is the foundation for the Message Hub feed? If it is "connections" then lets put a link here as well -->

## Difference between Feed and Trigger

Feeds and Triggers are closely related, but technically distinct concepts.   

- {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} processes **events** that flow into the system.

- A **Trigger** is technically a name for a class of events. Each event belongs to exactly one Trigger; by analogy, a Trigger resembles a *topic* in topic-based pub-sub systems. A **Rule** *T -> A* means "whenever an event from Trigger *T* arrives, invoke Action *A* with the Trigger payload.

- A **Feed** is a stream of events that all belong to some Trigger *T*. A Feed is controlled by a **Feed Action**, which handles creating, deleting, pausing, and resuming the stream of events that comprise a Feed. The Feed Action typically interacts with external services that produce the events, by using a REST API that manages notifications.

##  Implementing Feed Actions

The *Feed Action* is a normal {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} *Action*, and accepts the following parameters:
* **lifecycleEvent**: One of 'CREATE', 'READ', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'PAUSE', or 'UNPAUSE'.
* **triggerName**: The fully qualified name of the Trigger, which contains events that are produced from this Feed.
* **authKey**: The Basic auth credentials of the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} user who owns the Trigger.

The Feed Action can also accept any other parameters that it needs to manage the feed. For example, the cloudant changes Feed Action expects to receive parameters that include *'dbname'*, *'username'*, and so on.

When the user creates a Trigger from the CLI with the **--feed** parameter, the system automatically invokes the Feed Action with the appropriate parameters.

For example, assume that the user creates a **mycloudant** binding for the `cloudant` package with a username and password as bound parameters. When the user issues the following command from the CLI:
```
ic wsk trigger create T --feed mycloudant/changes -p dbName myTable
```
{: pre}

Then, under the covers the system does something equivalent to the following command:
```
ic wsk action invoke mycloudant/changes -p lifecycleEvent CREATE -p triggerName T -p authKey <userAuthKey> -p password <password value from mycloudant binding> -p username <username value from mycloudant binding> -p dbName mytype
```
{: pre}

The Feed Action that is named *changes* takes these parameters, and is expected to perform whatever action is necessary to set up a stream of events from Cloudant. The Feed Action occurs by using the appropriate configuration, which is directed to the Trigger *T*.

For the Cloudant *changes* Feed, the Action happens to talk directly to a *cloudant Trigger* service that is implemented with a connection-based architecture.

A similar Feed Action protocol occurs for `ic wsk trigger delete`, `ic wsk trigger update` and `ic wsk trigger get`.

## Implementing Feeds with Hooks

It is easy to set up a feed by using a hook if the event producer supports a webhook/callback facility.

With this method, there is _no need_ to stand up any persistent service outside of {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. All feed management happens naturally though stateless {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} *Feed Actions*, which negotiate directly with a third part webhook API.

When invoked with `CREATE`, the Feed Action simply installs a webhook for some other service, asking the remote service to POST notifications to the appropriate `fireTrigger` URL in {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}.

The webhook is directed to send notifications to a URL such as:

`POST /namespaces/{namespace}/triggers/{triggerName}`

The form with the POST request is interpreted as a JSON document that defines parameters on the Trigger event. {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Rules pass these Trigger parameters to any Actions to fire as a result of the event.

## Implementing Feeds with Polling

It is possible to set up an {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} *Action* to poll a feed source entirely within {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, without the need to stand up any persistent connections or external service.

For Feeds where a webhook is not available, but do not need high-volume or low latency response times, polling is an attractive option.

To set up a polling-based Feed, the Feed Action takes the following steps when called for `CREATE`:

1. The Feed Action sets up a periodic Trigger (*T*) with the desired frequency, by using the `whisk.system/alarms` Feed.
2. The Feed developer creates a `pollMyService` Action that polls the remote service and returns any new events.
3. The Feed Action sets up a *Rule* *T -> pollMyService*.

This procedure implements a polling-based Trigger entirely by using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Actions, without any need for a separate service.

## Implementing Feeds by using Connections

The previous two architectural choices are simple and easy to implement. However, if you want a high-performance feed, there is no substitute for persistent connections and long-polling or similar techniques.

Since {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Actions must be short-running, an Action cannot maintain a persistent connection to a third party. Instead, you can stand up a separate service, called *provider services*, outside of {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} that run all the time. A provider service can maintain connections to third-party event sources that support long polling or other connection-based notifications.

The provider service has a REST API that allows the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} *feed action* to control the feed. The provider service acts as a proxy between the event provider and {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. When it receives events from the third party, it sends them on to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} by firing a Trigger.

The Cloudant *changes* Feed is the canonical example as it stands up a `cloudanttrigger` service, which mediates between Cloudant notifications over a persistent connection, and {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Triggers.
<!-- TODO: add a reference to the open source implementation -->

The *alarm* Feed is implemented with a similar pattern.

The connection-based architecture is the highest performance option, but imposes more overhead on operations that are compared to the polling and hook architectures.
