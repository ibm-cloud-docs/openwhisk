# GitHub
{: #pkg_github}

This pre-installed package is not available in the Tokyo region.
{: tip}

The `/whisk.system/github` package offers a convenient way to use the [GitHub APIs ](https://developer.github.com/){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

The GitHub package includes the following entities.

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/github` | Package | `username`, `repository`, `accessToken` | Interact with the GitHub API. |
| `/whisk.system/github/webhook` | Feed | `events`, `username`, `repository`, `accessToken` | Fire trigger events on GitHub activity. |

Creating a package binding with the `username`, `repository`, and `accessToken` values is suggested.  With binding, you don't need to specify the values each time that you use the feed in the package.

## Firing a trigger event with GitHub activity

The `/whisk.system/github/webhook` feed configures a service to fire a trigger when there is activity in a specified GitHub repository. The parameters are as follows.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `username` | The user name of the GitHub repository. |
| `repository` | The GitHub repository. |
| `accessToken` | Your GitHub personal access token. When you [create your token, be sure to select the `repo:status` and `public_repo` scopes. Also, make sure that you don't have any webhooks that are already defined for your repository. |
| `events` | The [GitHub event type ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/) of interest. |

In the following example, a trigger is created that fires each time a new commit to a GitHub repository.

1. Generate a GitHub personal access token. Navigate to **GitHub.com** > **Settings** > **Personal access tokens** to generate a token. The access token will be used in the next step.

2. Create a package binding that is configured for your GitHub repository and with your access token.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/github myGit \
    --param username myGitUser \
    --param repository myGitRepo \
    --param accessToken aaaaa1111a1a1a1a1a111111aaaaaa1111aa1a1a
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Create a trigger for the GitHub `push` event type by using your `myGit/webhook` feed.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn trigger create myGitTrigger --feed myGit/webhook --param events push
  ```
  {: pre}

  A commit to the GitHub repository by using a `git push` causes the trigger to be fired by the webhook. If a rule matches the trigger, then the associated action is invoked. The action receives the GitHub webhook payload as an input parameter. Each GitHub webhook event has a similar JSON schema, but is a unique payload object that is determined by its event type. For more information about the payload content, see the [GitHub events and payload ](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/){: external} API documentation.
