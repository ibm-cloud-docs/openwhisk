# Cloudant

The `/whisk.system/cloudant` package enables you to work with a Cloudant database, and includes the following Actions and Feeds:

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/cloudant` | Package | dbname, host, username, password | Work with a Cloudant database. |
| `/whisk.system/cloudant/read` | Action | dbname, id | Read a document from a database. |
| `/whisk.system/cloudant/write` | Action | dbname, overwrite, doc | Write a document to a database. |
| `/whisk.system/cloudant/changes` | Feed | dbname, filter, query_params, maxTriggers | Fire Trigger events on changes to a database. |
{: shortdesc}

The following sections step you through setting up a Cloudant database, and how to read and write to it.
For more information on how to use Feeds with the `/whisk.system/cloudant` package, see [Cloudant events source](./openwhisk_cloudant.html).

## Setting up a Cloudant database in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #cloudantdb_cloud}

If you are using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} automatically creates package bindings for your Cloudant service instances. If you are not using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} and Cloudant from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, skip to the next section.

1. Create a Cloudant service instance in your [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard](http://console.bluemix.net).

  Be sure to create a Credential key for each new service instance.

2. Refresh the packages in your namespace. The refresh automatically creates a package binding for each Cloudant service instance with a credential key defined.
  ```
  ic wsk package refresh
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  created bindings:
  Bluemix_testCloudant_Credentials-1
  ```
  {: screen}

  ```
  ic wsk package list
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  packages
  /myBluemixOrg_myBluemixSpace/Bluemix_testCloudant_Credentials-1 private binding
  ```
  {: screen}

  Your package binding now contains the credentials that are associated with your Cloudant service instance.

3. Check to see that the package binding that was created previously is configured with your Cloudant {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service instance host and credentials.

  ```
  ic wsk package get /myBluemixOrg_myBluemixSpace/Bluemix_testCloudant_Credentials-1 parameters
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  ok: got package /myBluemixOrg_myBluemixSpace/Bluemix_testCloudant_Credentials-1, displaying field parameters
  
  [
      {
          "key": "username",
          "value": "cdb18832-2bbb-4df2-b7b1-Bluemix"
      },
      {
          "key": "host",
          "value": "cdb18832-2bbb-4df2-b7b1-Bluemix.cloudant.com"
      },
      {
          "key": "password",
          "value": "c9088667484a9ac827daf8884972737"
      }
  ]
  ```
  {: screen}

## Setting up a Cloudant database outside the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #cloudantdb_nocloud}

If you're not using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} or if you want to set up your Cloudant database outside of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you must manually create a package binding for your Cloudant account. You need the Cloudant account host name, user name, and password.

1. Create a package binding that is configured for your Cloudant account.
  ```
  wsk package bind /whisk.system/cloudant myCloudant -p username MYUSERNAME -p password MYPASSWORD -p host MYCLOUDANTACCOUNT.cloudant.com
  ```
  {: pre}
  

2. Verify that the package binding exists.
  ```
  wsk package list
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  packages
  /myNamespace/myCloudant private binding
  ```
  {: screen}

## Reading from a Cloudant database
{: #cloudant_read}

You can use an Action to fetch a document from a Cloudant database called **testdb**. Make sure that this database exists in your Cloudant account.

- Fetch a document by using the **read** Action in the package binding that you created previously. Be sure to replace `/_/myCloudant` with your package name.
  ```
  ic wsk action invoke /_/myCloudant/read --blocking --result --param dbname testdb --param id heisenberg
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  {
    "_id": "heisenberg",
    "_rev": "1-9a94fb93abc88d8863781a248f63c8c3",
    "name": "Walter White"
  }
  ```
  {: screen}

## Writing to a Cloudant database
{: #cloudant_write}

You can use an Action to store a document in a Cloudant database called **testdb**. Make sure that this database exists in your Cloudant account.

1. Store a document by using the **write** Action in the package binding you created previously. Be sure to replace `/_/myCloudant` with your package name.
  ```
  ic wsk action invoke /_/myCloudant/write --blocking --result --param dbname testdb --param doc "{\"_id\":\"heisenberg\",\"name\":\"Walter White\"}"
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Output:**
  ```
  ok: invoked /_/myCloudant/write with id 62bf696b38464fd1bcaff216a68b8287
  
  {
    "id": "heisenberg",
    "ok": true,
    "rev": "1-9a94fb93abc88d8863781a248f63c8c3"
  }
  ```
  {: screen}

2. Verify that the document exists by browsing for it in your Cloudant dashboard.

  The dashboard URL for the **testdb** database looks something like the following: `https://MYCLOUDANTACCOUNT.cloudant.com/dashboard.html#database/testdb/_all_docs?limit=100`.
