# Service configuration properties are incorrect
{: #ts_property}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

Your properties are not being set correctly. For example, the incorrect namespace is targeted.
{: tsSymptoms}

When a property is set, it is retained on your workstation at `<home_dir>/.bluemix/plugins/cloud-functions/config.json`.
{: tsCauses}

You might review your properties by using the `ibmcloud fn property get --all` command. You might need to run `ibmcloud fn property unset --<property>` to unset a specific property, then reset it. Or you might unset all properties by deleting the `config.json` file. This config file is re-created when you work with the service, for example, when you run `ibmcloud fn property get --all`.
{: tsResolve}
