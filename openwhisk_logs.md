# Logging and monitoring activity
{: #openwhisk_logs}

Logging and monitoring is automatically enabled in {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} to help you troubleshoot issues and improve the health and performance of your actions. You can also use the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} service.

## Viewing logs
{: #view-logs}

You can view activation logs directly from the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Monitoring dashboard. The logs are also forwarded to [{{site.data.keyword.loganalysisfull}}](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#analyzing_logs_Kibana) where they are indexed, enabling full-text search through all generated messages and convenient querying based on specific fields.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: Logging is not available for the US East region.

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Monitoring page ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard/).

2. Optional: To view logs only for a specific action, limit the monitoring summary to that action. In the Filtering Options section, select the action name from the **Limit to** drop-down list.

3. In the left-hand navigation, click **Logs**. The {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} Kibana page opens.

4. Optional: To see older logs, change the default timeframe value of 15 minutes by clicking **Last 15 minutes** in the upper right-hand corner and selecting a different timeframe.

### Querying logs
{: #query-logs}

You can find specific activation logs in [{{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#analyzing_logs_Kibana) by using Kibana's query syntax.

The following example queries can help you debug errors:
  * Find all error logs:
      ```
      type: user_logs AND stream_str: stderr
      ```
      {: codeblock}

  * Find all error logs that are generated by "myAction":
      ```
      type: user_logs AND stream_str: stderr AND action_str: "*myAction"
      ```
      {: codeblock}

### Querying results
{: #query-results}

In addition to log lines, [{{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#analyzing_logs_Kibana) also indexes the results, or the activation records, that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. The results contain activation metadata such as the activation duration or the activation result code. Querying result fields can help you understand how your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions are behaving.

You can find specific activation logs by using Kibana's query syntax. The following example queries can help you debug errors:

* Find all failed activations:
    ```
    type: activation_record AND NOT status_str: 0
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    In the results, a `0` indicates a successfully exited action and all other values indicate an error.

* Find all activations that failed with a specific error:
    ```
    type: activation_record AND NOT status_str:0 AND message: "*VerySpecificErrorMessage*"
    ```
    {: codeblock}



## Monitoring health of actions
{: #openwhisk_monitoring}

The [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard/) provides a graphical summary of your activity. Use the dashboard to determine the performance and health of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions.
{:shortdesc}

You can filter logs by selecting which action logs you want to view, and select the time frame of the activity logged. These filters are applied to all views on the dashboard. Click **Reload** at any time to update the dashboard with the latest activation log data.

### Activity Summary
{: #summary}

The **Activity Summary** view provides a high-level summary of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} environment. Use this view to monitor the overall health and performance of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}-enabled service. From the metrics in this view, you can do the following:
* Determine the usage rate of your service's {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}-enabled actions by viewing the number of times that they were invoked.
* Determine the overall rate of failure across all actions. If you see an error, you can isolate which services or actions had errors by viewing the **Activity Histogram** view. Isolate the errors themselves by viewing the **Activity Log**.
* Determine how well your actions are performing by viewing the average completion time that is associated with each action.

### Activity Timeline
{: #timeline}

The **Activity Timeline** view displays a vertical bar graph for viewing the activity of past and present actions. Red indicates errors within specific actions. Correlate this view with the **Activity Log** to find more details about errors.



### Activity Log
{: #log}

This **Activity Log** view displays a formatted version of the activation log. This view shows the details of every activation, but polls once a minute for new activations. Click an action to display a detailed log.

To get the output displayed in the Activity Log by using the CLI, use the following command:
```
ibmcloud fn activation poll
```
