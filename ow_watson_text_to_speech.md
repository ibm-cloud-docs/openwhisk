# {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package

The {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechfull}} service provides an API that uses IBM's speech-synthesis capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, dialects, and voices.
{:shortdesc}

The service supports at least one male or female voice, sometimes both, for each language. The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay. For more information about the service, see the [IBM Cloud documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/index.html).

The {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package contains the following entities. You can find additional details in the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} API reference by clicking the entity name.

## Creating a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance
{: #service_instance}

Before you install the package, you must create a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance and service credentials.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/text_to_speech).
2. When the service instance is created, auto-generated service credentials are also created for you.

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package
{: #install}

After you have an {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance, use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} CLI to install the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package into your namespace.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
  1. [Install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plugin for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](bluemix_cli.html#cloudfunctions_cli).
  2. Install the [`wskdeploy` command ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-wskdeploy/releases) and add the downloaded binary to your PATH.

To install the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package:

1. Clone the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/openwhisk-sdk
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Deploy the package.
    ```
    wskdeploy -m openwhisk-sdk/packages/text-to-speech-v1/manifest.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the package is added to your package list.
    ```
    ibmcloud wsk package list
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:
    ```
    packages
    /myOrg_mySpace/text-to-speech-v1                        private
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Bind the credentials from the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} instance you created to the package.
    ```
    ibmcloud wsk service bind text_to_speech text-to-speech-v1
    ```
    {: pre}

    Depending on the region where you created the service instance, the service instance might be named differently because it is an IAM service. If the above command fails, use the following service name for the bind command:
    ```
    ibmcloud wsk service bind text-to-speech text-to-speech-v1
    ```
    {: pre}
    Example output:
    ```
    Credentials 'Credentials-1' from 'text_to_speech' service instance 'Watson Text to Speech' bound to 'text-to-speech-v1'.
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Verify that the package is configured with your {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance credentials.
    ```
    ibmcloud wsk package get text-to-speech-v1 parameters
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    ok: got package text-to-speech-v1, displaying field parameters
    [
      {
        "key": "__bx_creds",
        "value": {
          "text_to_speech": {
            "credentials": "Credentials-1",
            "instance": "Watson Text to Speech",
            "password": "AAAA0AAAAAAA",
            "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/text_to_speech/api",
            "username": "00a0aa00-0a0a-12aa-1234-a1a2a3a456a7"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
    ```
    {: screen}

## Using the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package
{: #usage}

To use the actions in this package, run commands in the following format:

```
