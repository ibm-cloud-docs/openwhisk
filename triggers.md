# Creating triggers for events
{: #triggers}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

In {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}, a trigger is a declaration that you want to react to a certain type of event, whether from a user or by an event source.
{: shortdesc}

The following are examples of triggers.

- Location update events
- Document uploads to a website.
- Incoming email

## Creating triggers from the CLI
{: #triggers_create}

1. Create the trigger. Triggers must be created directly within a namespace and can't be created inside packages.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn trigger create TRIGGER_NAME
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    ok: created trigger TRIGGER_NAME
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Verify that the trigger is created.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn trigger list
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    triggers
    /<namespace_ID>/<TRIGGER_NAME>                            private
    ```
    {: screen}

Next, you can [test the trigger](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-test#test_triggers) or [create a rule](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-rules) to associate the trigger with an action.

## Difference between feed and trigger
{: #triggers_difference}

Feeds and triggers are closely related, but technically distinct concepts.

- {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} processes **events** that flow into the system.

- A **trigger** is a name for a class of events. Each event belongs to exactly one trigger; by analogy, a trigger resembles a topic in topic-based pub-sub systems. A **rule** is used to indicate that whenever an event from trigger arrives, invoke action with the trigger payload.

- A **feed** is a convenient way to configure an external event source to fire trigger events that can be consumed by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. A feed is a stream of events that all belong to some trigger. Pre-installed packages, installable packages, and your own custom packages might contain feeds.  A feed is controlled by a **feed action**, which handles creating, deleting, pausing, and resuming the stream of events that comprise a feed. The feed action typically interacts with external services that produce the events, by using a REST API that manages notifications.

Examples of feeds:

- An {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} data change feed that fires a trigger event each time a document in a database is added or modified.
- A Git feed that fires a trigger event for every commit to a Git repository.

## Creating a trigger for a feed
{: #triggers_feeds}

This example shows how to use a feed in the Alarms package to fire a trigger once a minute, and how to use a rule to invoke an action once a minute.

1. Get a description list of the entities in the `/whisk.system/alarms` package.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn package get --summary /whisk.system/alarms
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    package /whisk.system/alarms
        feed   /whisk.system/alarms/alarm
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Get a description of the feed in the `/whisk.system/alarms` package to see the parameters that you can use.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn action get --summary /whisk.system/alarms/alarm
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    action /whisk.system/alarms/alarm: Fire trigger when alarm occurs
        (params: cron trigger_payload)
    ```
    {: screen}

    The `/whisk.system/alarms/alarm` feed takes two parameters:
    - `cron`: A crontab specification of when to fire the trigger.
    - `trigger_payload`: The payload parameter value to set in each trigger event.

3. Create a trigger that fires every minute.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn trigger create everyOneMinute --feed /whisk.system/alarms/alarm -p cron "* * * * *" -p trigger_payload "{\"name\":\"Mork\", \"place\":\"Ork\"}"
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    ok: created trigger feed everyOneMinute
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Create an app. Example `hello.js`:

    ```javascript
    function main(params) {
        return {payload:  'Hello, ' + params.name + ' from ' + params.place};
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5. Create an action.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn action create hello hello.js
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Create a rule that invokes the `hello` action every time the `everyOneMinute` trigger fires.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn rule create myRule everyOneMinute hello
    ```
    {: pre}

    The following example shows possible output from the previous command.

    ```sh
    ok: created rule myRule
    ```
    {: screen}

7. Check that the action is being invoked by polling for activation logs.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn activation poll
    ```
    {: pre}

    You can see that the activations occur every minute for the trigger, the rule, and the action. The action receives the parameters `{"name":"Mork", "place":"Ork"}` on every invocation.
