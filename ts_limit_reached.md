# System limits were reached
{: #ts_limit_reached}

Your function is not running properly and might result in a message like `{"error":"signal: killed"}`.
{: tsSymptoms}

All functions have minimum and maximum [system limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-limits), such as memory usage maximum or a timeout.
{: tsCauses}

Some limits can be increased if a business case can justify higher safety limit values. To increase the limit value, contact IBM support by opening a ticket directly from the IBM Cloud Functions web console.
{: tsResolve}

1. Select **Support**.
2. Select **Add Ticket** from the drop-down menu.
3. Select **Technical** for the ticket type.
