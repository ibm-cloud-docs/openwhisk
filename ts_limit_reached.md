# System limits were reached
{: #ts_limit_reached}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

Your function is not running properly and might result in a message like `{"error":"signal: killed"}`.
{: tsSymptoms}

All functions have minimum and maximum [system limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-limits), such as memory usage maximum or a timeout.
{: tsCauses}

Some limits can be increased if a business case can justify higher safety limit values. To increase the limit value, contact IBM support by opening a ticket directly from the IBM Cloud Functions web console.
