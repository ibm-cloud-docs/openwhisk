# Associating triggers and actions through rules
{: #rules}

Every time the trigger fires, the rule uses the trigger event as input and invokes the associated action. With the appropriate set of rules, it's possible for a single trigger event to invoke multiple actions, or for an action to be invoked as a response to events from multiple triggers.
{: shortdesc}


## Rule creation from the UI
{: #rules_ui}

From the user interface, a rule to associate an action and a trigger is created for you.
{: shortdesc}

When you create or access the details for an action or trigger, you have the option of connecting an existing or a new action or trigger. When you make the connection, a rule is created for you and is named in the format `ACTION_NAME-TRIGGER_NAME`.

From the CLI, you can run `ibmcloud fn rule list` to verify that the rule was created for you.


## Creating rules from the CLI
{: #rules_create}

Rules are used to associate a trigger with an action. Each time a trigger event is fired, the action is invoked with the parameters from the trigger event.

Before you begin, create [an action](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-actions) and [a trigger](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-triggers).


Create a rule to associate a trigger with an action. Rules must be created directly within a namespace and can't be created inside packages.
```
ibmcloud fn rule create RULE_NAME TRIGGER_NAME ACTION_NAME
```
{: pre}


To disable the rule, you can run the following command.
```
ibmcloud fn rule disable RULE_NAME
```
{: pre}


## Creating rules for action sequences
{: #rules_seq}

You can use rules to associate triggers with action sequences.

Before you begin, create [an action sequence](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-actions#actions_seq) and [a trigger](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-triggers).

```
ibmcloud fn rule create RULE_NAME TRIGGER_NAME ACTION_SEQUENCE_NAME
```
{: pre}


## Associating multiple triggers and actions
{: #rules_assoc}

You can use different combinations of triggers and actions by creating a rule for each combination. You are not required to have a one to one ratio for actions and triggers.

For example, consider the following actions.
- `classifyImage` - An action that detects the objects in an image and classifies them.
- `thumbnailImage` - An action that creates a thumbnail version of an image.

Also suppose that two event sources are firing the following triggers.
- `newTweet` - A trigger that is fired when a new tweet is posted.
- `imageUpload` - A trigger that is fired when an image is uploaded to a website.

You can set up rules so that a single trigger event invokes multiple actions, and have multiple triggers invoke the same action.
- `newTweet -> classifyImage` rule
- `imageUpload -> classifyImage` rule
- `imageUpload -> thumbnailImage` rule

The three rules establish the following behavior.
- Images in both tweets are classified.
- Uploaded images are classified
- A thumbnail version is generated.
