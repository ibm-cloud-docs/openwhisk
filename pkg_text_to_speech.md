## Creating a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} Service instance
{: #service_instance_texttospeech}

Before you install the package, you must create a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} Service instance and service credentials.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Create a {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} Service instance ](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text_to_speech){: external}.
2. When the service instance is created, auto-generated service credentials are also created for you.

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package
{: #install_texttospeech}

After you have an {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} Service instance, install the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package into your namespace.
{: shortdesc}

## Installing from the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI
{: #texttospeech_cli}

Install the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package from the CLI. Be sure to [install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-cli_install) first.
{: shortdesc}

To install the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package, run the following commands.

1. Clone the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} package repo.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/openwhisk-sdk
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Deploy the package.

   ```
   ibmcloud fn deploy -m openwhisk-sdk/packages/text-to-speech-v1/manifest.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the package is added to your package list.

   ```
   ibmcloud fn package list
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Output**

   ```
   packages
   /myOrg_mySpace/text-to-speech-v1                        private
   ```
   {: screen}

4. Bind the credentials from the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} instance you created to the package.
  
   ```
   ibmcloud fn service bind text_to_speech text-to-speech-v1
   ```
   {: pre}

   Depending on the region where you created the service instance, the service instance might be named differently because it is an IAM service. If the above command fails, use the following service name for the bind command:
  
   ```
   ibmcloud fn service bind text-to-speech text-to-speech-v1
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example output**

   ```
   Credentials 'Credentials-1' from 'text_to_speech' service instance 'Watson Text to Speech' bound to 'text-to-speech-v1'.
   ```
   {: screen}

5. Verify that the package is configured with your {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} Service instance credentials.
  
   ```
   ibmcloud fn package get text-to-speech-v1 parameters
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example output**

   ```
   ok: got package text-to-speech-v1, displaying field parameters
   [
      {
        "key": "__bx_creds",
        "value": {
          "text_to_speech": {
            "credentials": "Credentials-1",
            "instance": "Watson Text to Speech",
            "password": "AAAA0AAAAAAA",
            "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/text_to_speech/api",
            "username": "00a0aa00-0a0a-12aa-1234-a1a2a3a456a7"
          }
        }
      }
   ]
   ```
   {: screen}
