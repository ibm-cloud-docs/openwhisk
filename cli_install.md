  API endpoint:      https://cloud.ibm.com   
  Region:            us-south   
  User:              <email>   
  Account:           (<account_id>) <-> <account>   
  Resource group:    default   
  CF API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.128.0)   
  Org:               <org_name>   
  Space:             <space_name>  
  ```
  {: screen} 

**Example** Creating namespaces for staging and production deployments.

You can create IAM-enabled namespaces to handle your pre-production (staging) and production {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} deployments by creating namespaces for each. Run [`ibmcloud fn namespace create`](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cli-plugin-functions-cli#cli_namespace_create) to create more namespaces under your organization such as "staging" and "production":

Create a staging namespace.
```
ibmcloud fn namespace create staging
```
{: pre}

Create a production namespace.
```
ibmcloud fn namespace create production
```
{: pre}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} has restrictions on namespace names. For more information, see the [System details and Limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-limits#limits_entities) documentation.
{: tip}


## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI to use an HTTPS proxy
{: #cli_proxy}

The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI can be set  up to use an HTTPS proxy. To set up an HTTPS proxy, an environment variable that is called `HTTPS_PROXY` must be created. The variable must be set to the address of the HTTPS proxy, and its port by using the following format: `{PROXY IP}:{PROXY PORT}`.

Changing the name of the org or space creates a new namespace based on the changed name. The entities in the old namespace are not visible in the new namespace and might be deleted.
{: important}


## Migrating from OpenWhisk CLI to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_migrate}

You can now use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to interact with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities. Although you can continue to use the stand-alone OpenWhisk CLI, it does not have the latest features that are supported by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, such as IAM-based namespaces and `service bind`.
{: shortdesc}


### Command Syntax
{: #cli_syntax}
For {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} command syntax, see the [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI reference](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cli-plugin-functions-cli).


### API Authentication and Host
{: #cli_api_auth}

With the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in, you don't need to explicitly configure the API key and API host. Instead, you can log in with `ibmcloud login`. You can target an IAM-enabled namespace by running `ibmcloud fn property set --namespace <namespace_name>` or a Cloud Foundry-based namespace by running `ibmcloud target --cf`. After logging in, all commands begin with `ibmcloud fn`.


If you need to use the authentication API key for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in an external HTTP client such as cURL or Postman, you can retrieve it with the following commands.

Get the current API key by running the following command.
```
ibmcloud fn property get --auth
```
{: pre}

Get the current API host by running the following command.
```
ibmcloud fn property get --apihost
```
{: pre}

The API key is specific per region, organization, and space targeted by the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in.
{: tip}


### API Gateway authentication
{: #cli_apigw_authentication}

The OpenWhisk CLI required you to run the `wsk ibmcloud login` to be able to configure the API Gateway authorization for management of your APIs by using the `wsk api` command. With the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in, you don't need to run `wsk ibmcloud login`. Instead, when you use the `ibmcloud login` command to log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} plug-in automatically utilizes your current login and target information. Now you can manage your APIs by using the `ibmcloud fn api` command.


### Migrating deployment scripts
{: #cli_migrating_deploy_scripts}

If you have scripts that use the OpenWhisk CLI with the `wsk` commands, all commands work the same way by using the command `ibmcloud fn`. You can modify your scripts to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI plug-in, or create an alias or wrapper so that current commands using `wsk` are translated to `ibmcloud fn`. The `ibmcloud login` and `ibmcloud target` commands in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI work in unattended mode. With unattended mode, you can configure your environment before you run `ibmcloud fn` commands to deploy and manage your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities.


## Migrating from OpenWhisk CLI to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_migrate_wsk}

The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in replaces the OpenWhisk stand-alone CLI (`wsk`) for interacting with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities in IBM Cloud. The `wsk` stand-alone CLI does not have the latest features that are supported by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, such as IAM-based namespace support and `service bind` support.
{: shortdesc}

**What does the command syntax look like?**

All of the command options and arguments for commands in the Cloud Functions CLI plug-in are the same as the options for the [OpenWhisk stand-alone CLI ](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-cli){: external}. But, note the following differences.

* The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} plug-in automatically utilizes your current login and target information.
* `wsk` commands are now run as `ibmcloud fn`.
* The `wsk ibmcloud login` command is no longer needed. You can sign in by using `ibmcloud login`.
* You can manage your APIs by using the `ibmcloud fn api`.

For more information, see the [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI reference](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cli-plugin-functions-cli).

**Do I still need to configure an API key?**

With the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in, you don't need to explicitly configure an API key and host like you previously needed to. Instead, you can log in and target your region with `ibmcloud login -a <region_api_endpoint>` and then target your namespace to start working with your entities.

If you're using the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} authentication API key in an external HTTP client such as cURL, you can retrieve it with the following commands.

Get the current API key.
```
ibmcloud fn property get --auth
```
{: pre}

Get the current API host.
```
ibmcloud fn property get --apihost
```
{: pre}

The API key is specific per region, organization, and space targeted by the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in.
