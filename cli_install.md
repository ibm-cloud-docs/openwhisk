# Installing the CLI and plug-in
{: #cli_install}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} offers a powerful plug-in for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI that allows complete management of the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} system. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to manage your code snippets in actions, create triggers and rules to enable your actions to respond to events, and bundle actions into packages.

## Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
{: #cli_setup}

Install the latest version of the IBM Cloud CLI.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin

You must create an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.

1. Download and install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

2. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

3. If you have more than one account, you are prompted to select which account to use. Follow the prompts or use the `target` command to select your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -c <account_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. You must also specify a region. You can use the `target` command to target or change regions.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -r <region>
    ```
    {: pre}

5. You must specify a resource group. To get a list of your resource groups, run the following command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource groups
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**

    ```sh
    Retrieving all resource groups under account <account_name> as email@ibm.com...
    OK
    Name      ID                                 Default Group   State   
    default   a8a12accd63b437bbd6d58fb8b462ca7   true            ACTIVE
    test      a8a12abbbd63b437cca6d58fb8b462ca7   false           ACTIVE
    ```
    {: screen}

6. Target a resource group by running the following command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -g <resource_group>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**

    ```sh
    Targeted resource group default
    ```
    {: screen}

## Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_plugin_setup}

To work with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, download and install the CLI plug-in.
{: shortdesc}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to perform the following tasks.

* Run your code snippets, or actions, on {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. See [Creating and invoking actions](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions).
* Create triggers and rules to enable your actions to respond to events. See [Creating triggers and rules](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-triggers).
* Bundle actions and configure external events sources. See [Create and use packages](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_ov).
* Explore the catalog of packages and enhance your applications with external services. See [Adding {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-services).

Complete the following steps to install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in

1. Install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin install cloud-functions
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Verify that the plug-in is installed.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin list
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example Output**

    ```sh
    Plugin Name          Version
    cloud-functions/wsk/functions/fn      1.0.32
    ```
    {: screen}

3. All {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} commands begin with **`ibmcloud fn`**. To see everything that you can do with the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in, run **`ibmcloud fn`** with no arguments.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud fn
    ```
    {: pre}

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} commands, see the [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI reference](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-functions-cli).

## Next steps for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} CLI
{: #install_next}

To work with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities, you must first create or target a namespace. For more information, see [Managing namespaces](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces).

## Updating the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_update}

You might want to update the CLI periodically to use new features.
{: shortdesc}

1. View your current plug-in list by running `ibmcloud plugin list` command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin list
    ```
    {: pre}


    **Example Output**

    ```sh
    Plugin Name                                 Version   Status        
    cloud-functions/wsk/functions/fn            1.0.35    Update Available   
    cloud-object-storage                        1.1.0        
    container-registry                          0.1.437      
    container-service/kubernetes-service        0.4.51       
    ```
    {: screen}

2. If an update is available, run the **`ibmcloud plugin update`** command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin update cloud-functions
    ```
    {: pre}

## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI to use an HTTPS proxy
{: #cli_proxy}

The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI can be set  up to use an HTTPS proxy. To set up an HTTPS proxy, an environment variable that is called `HTTPS_PROXY` must be created. The variable must be set to the address of the HTTPS proxy, and its port by using the following format: `{PROXY IP}:{PROXY PORT}`.
{: shortdesc}

Changing the name of the `org` or `space` creates a new namespace based on the changed name. The entities in the old namespace are not visible in the new namespace and might be deleted.
{: important}

## Migrating from OpenWhisk CLI to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_migrate}

You can now use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to interact with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities. Although you can continue to use the stand-alone OpenWhisk CLI, it does not have the latest features that are supported by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, such as IAM-based namespaces and `service bind`.
{: shortdesc}

### Command syntax
{: #cli_syntax}

All the command options and arguments for commands in the Cloud Functions CLI plug-in are the same as the options for the [OpenWhisk stand-alone CLI](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-cli){: external} with the following differences.
{: shortdesc}

* The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} plug-in automatically utilizes your current login and target information.
* `wsk` commands are now run as `ibmcloud fn`.
* The **`wsk ibmcloud login`** command is no longer needed. You can sign in by using **`ibmcloud login`** command.
* You can manage your APIs by using the **`ibmcloud fn api`** commands.

For more information, see the [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI reference](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-functions-cli).

### API Authentication and Host
{: #cli_api_auth}


With the Cloud Functions CLI plug-in, you don't need to explicitly configure the API key and API host. Instead, you can log in with the `ibmcloud login` command. You can target an IAM-enabled namespace or Cloud Foundry-based namespace by running `ibmcloud fn property set --namespace <namespace_name_or_ID>`. After you log in, all commands begin with `ibmcloud fn`.
  




### Migrating deployment scripts
{: #cli_migrating_deploy_scripts}

If you have scripts that use the OpenWhisk CLI with the **`wsk`** commands, all commands work the same way by using the command **`ibmcloud fn`**. You can modify your scripts to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI plug-in, or create an alias or wrapper so that current commands that use `wsk` are translated to **`ibmcloud fn`**. The **`ibmcloud login`** and **`ibmcloud target`** commands in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI work in unattended mode. With unattended mode, you can configure your environment before you run **`ibmcloud fn`** commands to deploy and manage your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities.
