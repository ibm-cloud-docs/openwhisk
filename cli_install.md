# Installing the CLI and plug-in
{: #cli_install}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} offers a powerful plug-in for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI that allows complete management of the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} system. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to manage your code snippets in actions, create triggers and rules to enable your actions to respond to events, and bundle actions into packages.
{:shortdesc}


## Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI
{: #cli_setup}

Download and install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI, and log in.
{: shortdesc}

1. Download and install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

2. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. To specify an IBM Cloud region, [include the API endpoint](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cloudfunctions_regions).

  ```
  ibmcloud login
  ```
  {: pre}

  You can specify the organization and space when you log in to skip the prompts for them by using the following flags: `ibmcloud login -o <ORG> -s <SPACE>`
  {: tip}

3. If you did not specify an org and space, complete the prompts that follow the login command.


## Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in
{: #cli_plugin_setup}

To work with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, download and install the CLI plug-in.
{: shortdesc}

You can use the plug-in to:

* Run your code snippets, or actions, on {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. See [Creating and invoking actions](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-actions).
* Use triggers and rules to enable your actions to respond to events. See [Creating triggers and rules](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-triggers).
* Learn how packages bundle actions and configure external events sources. See [Create and use packages](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-pkg_ov).
* Explore the catalog of packages and enhance your applications with external services, such as a [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} event source](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-pkg_cloudant).

To see everything that you can do with the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in, run `ibmcloud fn` with no arguments.
{: tip}

1. Install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in.

  ```
  ibmcloud plugin install cloud-functions
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Verify that the plug-in is installed.

  ```
  ibmcloud plugin list
  ```
  {: pre}

  Output:
  ```
  Plugin Name          Version
  cloud-functions/wsk/functions/fn      1.0.30
  ```
  {: screen}

Already have the plug-in but need to update? Run `ibmcloud plugin update cloud-functions`.
{:tip}



## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI to use an HTTPS proxy
{: #cli_proxy}

The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI can be set  up to use an HTTPS proxy. To set up an HTTPS proxy, an environment variable that is called `HTTPS_PROXY` must be created. The variable must be set to the address of the HTTPS proxy, and its port by using the following format: `{PROXY IP}:{PROXY PORT}`.



## Switching to different regions, organizations, and spaces<
{: #cli_regions}

If you are already logged in, you can run the `ibmcloud target` command in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to switch regions, organization, and spaces.

To create and manage entities, you must target a namespace. The default namespace, which can be denoted by an underscore (`_`) in some situations, corresponds to the Cloud Foundry-based namespace that is currently targeted.

You can create IAM-based spaces to handle your pre-production (staging) and production deployments by creating spaces for each. Creating spaces allows {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} to have two different namespaces that are defined for you. Run [`ibmcloud iam space-create`](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-ibmcloud_commands_account#ibmcloud_account_space_create) to create more spaces under your organization such "staging" and "production":

```
ibmcloud iam space-create "staging"
ibmcloud iam space-create "production"
```
{: pre}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} has restrictions on namespace names. For more information, refer to the [System details and Limits](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-limits#limits_entities) documentation.
{: tip}

**Warning**: Changing the name of the org or space creates a new namespace based on the changed name. The entities in the old namespace are not visible in the new namespace and might be deleted.


## Migrating from OpenWhisk CLI to {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in
{: #cli_migrate}

You can now use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in to interact with {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities. Although you can continue to use the stand-alone OpenWhisk CLI, it will not have the latest features that are supported by {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}, such as IAM-based namespaces and `service bind`.
{: shortdesc}

### Command Syntax
{: #cli_syntax}

All `wsk` commands, except the `wsk bluemix login` command that is no longer needed, work the same way by using the command `ibmcloud fn`. All command options and arguments for commands in the Cloud Functions CLI plug-in are the same as the commands for the OpenWhisk stand-alone CLI. For more information, see the [Apache OpenWhisk CLI project ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-cli).

### API Authentication and Host
{: #cli_api_auth}

The OpenWhisk CLI required you to configure the authentication API key and the API host. With the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in, you don't need to explicitly configure the API key and API host. Instead, you can log in with `ibmcloud login`. You can target an IAM-enabled namespace by running `ibmcloud fn property set --namespace NAME` or a Cloud Foundry-based namespace by running `ibmcloud target -o ORG -s SPACE`. After logging in, all commands begin with `ibmcloud fn`.


If you need to use the authentication API key for {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} in an external HTTP client such as cURL or Postman, you can retrieve it with the following commands:

To get the current API key:
```
ibmcloud fn property get --auth
```
{: pre}

To get the current API host:
```
ibmcloud fn property get --apihost
```
{: pre}

The API key is specific per region, organization, and space targeted by the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in.
{: tip}

### API Gateway authentication
{: #cli_apigw_authentication}

The OpenWhisk CLI required you to run the `wsk bluemix login` to be able to configure the API Gateway authorization for management of your APIs by using the `wsk api` command. With the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI plug-in, you don't need to run `wsk bluemix login`. Instead, when you use the `ibmcloud login` command to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} plug-in automatically utilizes your current login and target information. Now you can manage your APIs by using the `ibmcloud fn api` command.

### Migrating deployment scripts
{: #cli_migrating_deploy_scripts}

If you have scripts that use the OpenWhisk CLI with the `wsk` binary, all commands work the same way by using the command `ibmcloud fn`. You can modify your scripts to use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI plug-in, or create an alias or wrapper so that current commands using `wsk` are translated to `ibmcloud fn`. The `ibmcloud login` and `ibmcloud target` commands in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI work in unattended mode. With unattended mode, you can configure your environment before you run `ibmcloud fn` commands to deploy and manage your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} entities.
