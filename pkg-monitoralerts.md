You can use monitoring to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. When you set up monitoring, you can define [alerts](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/alerts.html){: external} that notify you when an event or an issue occurs that requires your attention. You can send alerts over a variety of [supported notification channels](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-notifications){: external}, including {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} actions. For more information, see [Sending SMS alerts using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-cf_sms).
