# Monitor activity with Dashboard

The [{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/dashboard/) provides a graphical summary of your activity. Use the dashboard to determine the performance and health of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Actions.
{:shortdesc}

Click **Reload** at any time to update the dashboard with the latest activation log data.

## Activity Summary
{: #summary}

This view provides a high-level summary of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} environment. Use the **Activity Summary** view to monitor the overall health and performance of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} enabled service. From the metrics in this view, you can do the following:
* Determine the usage rate of your service's {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} enabled Actions by viewing the number of times that they were invoked.
* Determine the overall rate of failure across all Actions. If you spot an error, you can isolate which services or Actions had errors by viewing the **Activity Histogram** view. Isolate the errors themselves by viewing the **Activity Log**.
* Determine how well your Actions are performing by viewing the average completion time that is associated with each Action.

<!-- For tips on improving performance, see troubleshooting? -->
