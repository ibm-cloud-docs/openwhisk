# Action is failing
{: #ts_action_fails}

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} is deprecated. Existing Functions entities such as actions, triggers, or sequences will continue to run, but as of 28 December 2023, you canâ€™t create new Functions entities. Existing Functions entities are supported until October 2024. Any Functions entities that still exist on that date will be deleted. For more information, see [Deprecation overview](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-dep-overview).
{: deprecated}

The action is failing.
{: tsSymptoms}

One explanation for a failing app is that a deprecated runtime is being used. An action cannot be completed successfully until the runtime is updated to a supported one.
{: tsCauses}

To see which runtime is used for the action, run `ibmcloud fn action get ACTION_NAME` and check for `deprecated=true` in the query response. If the runtime is deprecated, [update the runtime](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions#actions_update). For more information, see [Runtimes](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-runtimes).
{: tsResolve}
