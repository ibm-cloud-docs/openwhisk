# Object Storage
{: #pkg_obstorage}

You can extend the functionality of your {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} app by integrating with an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} instance.

**Before you begin** 
To learn about {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, see [About Object Storage](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api). For more information about setting up the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance, see [Provision an instance {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-gs-dev#gs-dev-provision).

## Packages
{: #obstorage_packages}
| Package | Availability | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package](#pkg_obstorage)| Installable | Read, write, and delete from an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance. |
| [(Experimental) {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} events source](#pkg_obstorage_ev) | Pre-installed (US-South only) | Listen for changes to an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance. |

## Creating an IBM Cloud Object Storage service instance
{: #pkg_obstorage_service}

Before you can use either package, you must request an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} and create at least one bucket.

1. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-gs-dev#gs-dev-provision).

2. [Create a set of HMAC service credentials ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials) for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance. In the **Add Inline Configuration Parameters (Optional)** field, add `{"HMAC":true}`.

3. [Create at least one bucket ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started#gs-create-buckets).

## Reading and writing to a bucket by using the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package
{: #pkg_obstorage_install}

After you have an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance, you can use either the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} CLI or UI to install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package into your namespace.
{: shortdesc}

### Installing from the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI
{: #pkg_obstorage_cli}

**Before you begin**

[Install the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} plug-in for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-cli_install).

To install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package:

1. Clone the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-functions/package-cloud-object-storage.git
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Navigate to either the `runtimes/nodejs` or `runtimes/python` directory. Actions in the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} package are deployed in the runtime that you choose.
    ```
    cd package-cloud-object-storage/runtimes/nodejs
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Deploy the package. You can repeat the previous steps to redeploy the package in another runtime.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn deploy -m manifest.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify that the `cloud-object-storage` package is added to your package list.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn package list
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Output**
    ```
    packages
    /myOrg_mySpace/cloud-object-storage private
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Bind the credentials from the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance you created to the package.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn service bind cloud-object-storage cloud-object-storage
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**
    ```
    Credentials 'Credentials-1' from 'cloud-object-storage' service instance 'Cloud Object Storage-r1' bound to 'cloud-object-storage'.
    ```
    {: screen}

6. Verify that the package is configured with your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance credentials.
    ```
    ibmcloud fn package get /myBOrg_mySpace/cloud-object-storage parameters
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**
    ```

## Listening for changes to a bucket by using the (Experimental) Object Storage events source
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev}

The `/whisk.system/cos-experimental` package might be unstable, change frequently in ways that aren't compatible with earlier versions, and might be discontinued with a short notice. This package isn't recommended for use in production environments. This experimental package is available only in the US-South region.
{: important}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} to listen for changes to an [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api-bucket-operations) bucket and use an action to process one or more objects from the bucket.

<br>

**Sample use case:** With the `/whisk.system/cos-experimental` package, you can listen for changes to GPS street data stored in an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. Then, when changes occur, you can trigger the automatic regeneration of a GPS map so that users can have access to the latest street data for their GPS application.

### (Experimental) Object Storage events source parameters
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_ch}

With the `/whisk.system/cos-experimental` package, you can configure events from an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance, and includes the following feed:

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/cos-experimental` | Package | `apikey`, `auth_endpoint`, `bucket`, `endpoint`, `interval` | Package containing the `changes` feed action. |
| `/whisk.system/cos-experimental/changes` | Feed | `apikey`, `auth_endpoint`, `bucket`, `endpoint`, `interval` | Fire trigger events on changes to an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. |
{: shortdesc}

You can use the `changes` feed to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} events source service to fire a trigger on every change to a bucket in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance.

Parameters that are used in this example:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apikey` |  _(Required, unless bound to the package)_. The `apikey` parameter is IAM API key for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance.  Normally, this value is bound to the package. However, if the `apikey` value is specified when using the `changes` feed action, the specified value is used for the credentials instead of the bound credentials' apikey. |
| ` auth_endpoint` |  _(Optional)_. The `auth_endpoint` parameter is the authorization endpoint that is used by {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} to generate a token from the `apikey`.  The default endpoint is the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} endpoint. |
| `bucket` | _(Required)_. The `bucket` parameter is the name of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. |
| `endpoint` |  _(Required)_. The `endpoint` parameter is the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} endpoint used to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance. You can locate your endpoint in the [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints). |
| `interval` | _(Optional)_. The `interval` parameter is the bucket polling interval, in whole minutes. The `interval` value must be at least 1 minute and is set to 1 minute by default. |

### Creating a trigger to respond to the changes feed
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_trig}

When creating the trigger, you can avoid passing your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials to the `changes` feed action by binding your credentials directly to the `cos-experimental` package.
{: shortdesc}

 1. First, create a package binding that can be modified to contain your credentials. The following creates a package binding, `myCosPkg`, in your namespace.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/cos-experimental myCosPkg
  ```
  {: pre}

 2. Bind your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials to the package. Binding your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials to the package binds the `apikey` value to the package so you don't need to specify the `apikey` value when the `changes` feed action is invoked.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn service bind cloud-object-storage myCosPkg
  ```
  {: pre}

 3. Create a trigger named `myCosTrigger` with the `changes` feed in the package binding that you created. Use your bucket name and {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} endpoint parameter values.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn trigger create myCosTrigger --feed myCosPkg/changes \
  --param bucket myBucket \
  --param endpoint s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud
  ```
  {: pre}

  **Example output**

    ```
    ok: created trigger feed myCosTrigger
    ```
  {: pre}
 

Create a simple action to verify that the trigger, the change feed, and the rule are all configured and working correctly. For example:
 
  1. Save the following JavaScript code as `showCosChange.js`. 

  ```javascript
  function main(data) {
      console.log(data);
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  2. Create an action called `showCosChange` by using the `showCosChange.js` code.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn action create showCosChange <filepath>/showCosChange.js
  ```
  {: pre}

  3. Create a rule to connect the `showCosChange` action to the `myCosTrigger` trigger.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn rule create myCosRule myCosTrigger showCosChange
  ```
  {: pre}

  4. In a separate window, start polling for activations to give clear visibility of what is happening. When the trigger fires and the action is run, this command lists the activation records for each of these operations as they occur.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn activation poll
  ```
  {: pre}
  
  5. In your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} dashboard, either modify an existing bucket object or create one. To learn how to add an object to your bucket, see [Add some objects to your bucket](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started#gs-add-objects).
  
  6. For each bucket object change, observe new activations for the `myCosTrigger` trigger and `showCosChange` action. You can view these activations by running the `ibmcloud fn activation poll` command within the configured bucket polling interval.
  
  7. If you are unable to observe new activations, verify that the `apikey`, `endpoint`, and `bucket` parameter values are correct.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn trigger get myCosTrigger
  ```
  {: pre}


### Data structure of an Object Storage trigger event
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_data}

The content of the generated events has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | The file or object metadata. This structure is described in [List objects in a specific bucket](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api-bucket-operations#compatibility-api-list-buckets). |
| `status` | The detected change.  This value is either `added`, `modified` or `deleted`. |
| `bucket`| The name of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. |
| `endpoint` | The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} endpoint used to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance. |
| `key` | The identifier of the changed bucket object. This value is the same as `file.Key`, but available at the top of the trigger event JSON. |

**Example JSON representation of the bucket change trigger event**

```json
{
  "file": {
    "ETag": "\"fb47672a6f7c34339ca9f3ed55c6e3a9\"",
    "Key": "file-86.txt",
    "LastModified": "2018-12-19T08:33:27.388Z",
    "Owner": {
      "DisplayName": "80a2054e-8d16-4a47-a46d-4edf5b516ef6",
      "ID": "80a2054e-8d16-4a47-a46d-4edf5b516ef6"
    },
    "Size": 25,
    "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
  },
  "status": "added",
  "bucket": "myBucket",
  "endpoint": "s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud",
  "key": "file-86.txt"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Creating an action to process the changed object
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_act}

You can create a single action that retrieves and processes the object. Or, you can create a sequence that uses one action to retrieve the object and another action to process the object.

### Creating an action to retrieve and process the object
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_act_ret}

This sample action code retrieves and processes the bucket change notification document. You can pass the `apikey` and `serviceInstanceId` parameters directly to the action during manual action invocation, but when this action is invoked by a trigger these values must be obtained from your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, which must be bound to the action with the `ibmcloud fn service bind` command.

1. Save the following code into a .zip file called `myCosAction.zip`.

  ```javascript
  const COS = require('ibm-cos-sdk')

  function main(params){
    const apikey = params.apikey || params.__bx_creds['cloud-object-storage'].apikey
    const serviceInstanceId = params.serviceInstanceId || params.__bx_creds['cloud-object-storage'].resource_instance_id
    const ibmAuthEndpoint = params.ibmAuthEndpoint
    const endpoint = params.endpoint
    const bucket = params.bucket
    const file = params.key

    const cos_config = { endpoint: endpoint, apiKeyId: apikey, ibmAuthEndpoint: ibmAuthEndpoint, serviceInstanceId: serviceInstanceId }
    const client = new COS.S3(cos_config);

    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      client.getObject({ Bucket: bucket, Key: file }, (err, results) => {
        if (err != null) {
          console.log(err)
          reject({ err: err })
        } else {
          console.log(results)
          resolve({ contents: Buffer.from(results.Body).toString() })
        }
      })
    });
  }
  exports.main = main;
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  Because this action uses the `ibm-cos-sdk` NPM package, the action must be packaged as either a [Node.js module](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-prep#prep_js_npm) or a [single bundle](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-prep#prep_js_pkg).

2. Create the action to retrieve and process the object from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}:

  ```
  ibmcloud fn action create myCosAction <filepath>/myCosAction.zip --kind nodejs:10
  ```
  {: pre}

### Creating an action sequence to retrieve and process the object
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_act_seq}

Instead of including the object retrieval code in your action, you can use the `object-read` action from the `cloud-object-storage` package, which must be [manually installed](#pkg_obstorage_install).  Your action code only needs to process the results returned from `object-read`.
{: shortdesc}

To create an action that only processes the bucket object:

1. Save the following code as `myCosAction.js`.

  ```javascript
  function main(data) {
    if (data) {
      // Process the object
    }
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Create the action to process only the object from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn action create myCosProcessObjectAction <filepath>/myCosAction.js
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Bind your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials to your manually installed `cloud-object-storage` package.

  ```
  ibmcloud fn service bind cloud-object-storage cloud-object-storage
  ```
  {: pre}

4. The `object-read` action can be composed with `myCosProcessObjectAction` to create an action sequence.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn action create myCosAction --sequence cloud-object-storage/object-read,myCosProcessObjectAction
  ```
  {: pre}

In addition to the `object-read` action, you can use other actions that are included in the installable `cloud-object-storage` package.

### Binding credentials to your action
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_bind}

You can avoid passing sensitive credentials during invocation by binding the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} credentials to the action by using the following command:
  ```
  ibmcloud fn service bind cloud-object-storage myCosAction
  ```
  {: pre}

### Creating a rule to associate the action with the change trigger
{: #pkg_obstorage_ev_rule}

{: #openwhisk_catalog_cloud_object_storage_read_change notoc}

You can use an action or action sequence in a [rule](/docs/openwhisk?topic=cloud-functions-rules) to fetch and process the object that is associated with an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} change event.

Create a rule that activates `MyCosAction` action on new {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} trigger events.
  ```
  ibmcloud fn rule create myRule myCosTrigger myCosAction
  ```
  {: pre}
